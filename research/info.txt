Question......

Loading the original pretrained weights is not the problem?
But training it is the problem.
So that's why we freeze these weights during training .
But updates only the 2 smaller low rank matrices.

So , loading the original weights isn't the problem.Training the original weights is the problem




Answer....


Exactly! You've summarized it perfectly:

### **Key Points:**
1. **Loading the Original Pretrained Weights:**
   - Loading the large pretrained weights (\( W \)) into memory is typically **not the bottleneck**. These weights are required to retain the general-purpose knowledge the model has learned during pretraining.
   - These weights are frozen, meaning they are **not modified** during fine-tuning.

2. **Training the Original Weights:**
   - Training large weight matrices like \( W \) requires significant memory and computational resources, especially for models with billions of parameters.
   - Fine-tuning all weights would require gradients and optimizers for \( W \), increasing memory usage dramatically.

3. **Why Freezing Helps:**
   - By freezing \( W \), we **eliminate the need to compute gradients** and perform updates for these large matrices during fine-tuning. This significantly reduces memory usage and computational overhead.

4. **LoRA's Solution:**
   - Instead of updating \( W \) directly, LoRA introduces two smaller low-rank matrices \( A \) and \( B \), which together represent the update \( \Delta W = A \cdot B \).
   - Training these smaller matrices is much more memory-efficient because their size is small compared to \( W \).

---

### **Analogy**
Imagine \( W \) is a massive book that you’ve already written. If you want to make small adjustments to tailor it for a specific audience, instead of rewriting the entire book:
- You freeze the book’s contents (keep \( W \) fixed).
- You write an **appendix or a supplement** (the smaller matrices \( A \) and \( B \)) with targeted updates.

This allows you to customize the book for different audiences (tasks) without rewriting or duplicating the entire original book.

---

### **Bottom Line**
The challenge isn’t loading the pretrained weights but rather training them during fine-tuning. By freezing \( W \) and training only \( A \) and \( B \), LoRA achieves efficient fine-tuning while keeping the memory and computational demands low.




SVD vs LORA

SVD is a linear algebraic tool used for approximating a matrix by retaining the most important components (singular values and corresponding singular vectors). It provides an optimal low-rank approximation of a matrix in terms of minimizing the Frobenius norm (i.e., it minimizes the sum of squared errors between the original matrix and the approximation).

LoRA, on the other hand, introduces low-rank updates during fine-tuning, but not by directly performing SVD. Instead, it approximates the weight updates as a product of low-rank matrices, and this product is learned during fine-tuning (i.e., these matrices are updated through backpropagation based on the task at hand). It's a learned low-rank approximation, not a mathematical one like SVD.
